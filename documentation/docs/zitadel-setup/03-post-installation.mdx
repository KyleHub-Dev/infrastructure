# Post-Installation

## 1. Create Pangolin Resource for Access

Before accessing Zitadel, you need to create a resource in Pangolin to access it through your private LAN:

1. After creating the site, click on the **Resources** tab in the left sidebar
2. Click **Add Resource**
3. Configure the Zitadel resource:
   - **Name**: `Zitadel Dashboard` (or any descriptive name)
   - **Resource Type**: `HTTP Resource` (select this since Zitadel expects HTTP internally)
   - **Subdomain**: `auth` (or `auth.yourdomain.com` as the full domain)
   - **Method/Protocol**: `http` (Pangolin handles TLS externally while Zitadel listens on HTTP)
   - **IP/Hostname**: `192.168.1.51` (Zitadel container's internal IP)
   - **Port**: `8080` (Zitadel web interface port)
4. Click **Save** or **Create**

**Note**: Zitadel still serves HTTP internally on port 8080. Pangolin terminates TLS at the edge and forwards cleartext HTTP/2 (h2c) traffic to the backend.

## 2. Configure Zitadel Before First Login

Once installation completes, the helper script prints a summary similar to:

```
Completed Successfully!

ZITADEL setup has been successfully initialized!
Access it using the following URL:
   http://YOUR_IP:8080/ui/console
```

Before using that URL, configure Zitadel with the public hostname Pangolin exposes. Otherwise, redirects and cookies will fail when you sign in through Pangolin.

### 2.1 Update the configuration file

The main configuration lives at `/opt/zitadel/config.yaml`.

1. In the Proxmox console for the Zitadel container, open the configuration file:

```bash
nano /opt/zitadel/config.yaml
```

2. Ensure the external section matches your domain and Pangolin port:

```yaml
ExternalDomain: auth.yourdomain.com
ExternalPort: 443
ExternalSecure: true
```

3. Save the file, make the helper script executable, and rerun Zitadel so the changes take effect:

```bash
chmod +x ~/zitadel-rerun.sh
bash ~/zitadel-rerun.sh
```

The script stops Zitadel, reapplies configuration, and starts the service. If "Failed to fetch" errors persist after the rerun, review the [Troubleshooting](07-troubleshooting.mdx) guide for advanced troubleshooting.

## 3. Access Zitadel

With the external domain configured, you can now access the console through Pangolin.

**Default Login Credentials:**
- **Username**: `zitadel-admin@zitadel.localhost`
- **Password**: `Password1!`

**Important**: Change this default password immediately after first login!

1. Open your browser and navigate to `https://auth.yourdomain.com/ui/console`
2. Login with the default credentials above
3. The initial setup wizard will guide you through:
   - Creating/changing your organization settings
   - Updating the administrator account
   - Configuring basic settings
4. **Immediately change the default password** to a strong, unique password
5. Save the new credentials securely

## 4. Retrieve Credentials

Database credentials are stored in the container:

```bash
pct exec <container-id> -- cat ~/zitadel.creds
```

You'll find:
- Database name
- Database user credentials
- Database admin credentials
- Config file location
- Master encryption key

**Important**: Store these credentials securely!

## 5. Secure Initial Setup

**Important**: After logging in with the default credentials, immediately secure the admin account and disable self-registration.

1. You should now be logged in with the default administrator account
2. **Disable self-registration**:
   - Navigate to **Default-Settings** → **Login Behavior and Security** 
   - Scroll down to **Login Form** and 
   - Find the **User Registration allowed** option, uncheck it.
   - Find the **Organization Registration allowed** option, uncheck it.
   - Find the **External Login allowed** option, uncheck it if you do not plan to use external IdPs. 
   - Save the changes

This ensures your account is secure and only administrators can create new user accounts.

## 6 Alternative: Create Users as Admin

If you prefer to keep email verification enabled but need to create users without SMTP:

1. **Create users directly as an administrator**:
   - Go to **Users** → **Create User**
   - Fill in user details (email, username, etc.)
   - **Important**: Check for options like "Send invitation email" or "Skip email verification"
   - Set a temporary password directly in the user creation form

2. **Retrieve verification codes from Zitadel logs** (if email verification is required):
   ```bash
   # In the container console
   journalctl -u zitadel -f | grep -i "verification\|code\|email"
   ```
   This may show verification codes in the logs.

3. **Check the database directly** (advanced):
   ```bash
   # Access PostgreSQL
   sudo -u postgres psql -d zitadel
   
   # Query for verification codes (be careful with production data)
   SELECT * FROM auth.verification_codes ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;
   ```

**Recommended**: Disable email verification entirely for personal setups - it's simpler and more practical.

## 7. Next steps

- Continue with [Initial Project Setup](04-initial-project-setup.mdx) to replace the bootstrap admin with your own IAM owner account.
- When you're ready to delegate Pangolin authentication to Zitadel, follow the [Pangolin Auth Provider Setup](05-pangolin-auth-provider-setup.mdx).
